# Hyperion Fleet Manager - Host-Specific Variables Directory
# =============================================================================
# This directory contains host-specific variable files.
#
# Usage:
#   Create a YAML file named after the inventory hostname to define
#   variables specific to that host.
#
# Example:
#   host_vars/hyperion-web-prod-01.yml:
#   ---
#   ansible_host: 10.0.1.50
#   hyperion_custom_setting: value
#
# Variable Precedence:
#   host_vars take precedence over group_vars, allowing you to override
#   group-level settings for specific hosts.
#
# Security Note:
#   For sensitive host-specific values (credentials, keys), use Ansible Vault:
#   ansible-vault create host_vars/hostname.yml
#   ansible-vault edit host_vars/hostname.yml
#
# Best Practices:
#   - Use host_vars sparingly; prefer group_vars for consistency
#   - Document why a host needs specific overrides
#   - Review host_vars during security audits
#   - Keep file names consistent with inventory hostnames
